# ProjectVAE_MODNet
This repository contains files regarding the calculation and implementation of autoencoders for features in MODNet.
Autoencoders, and specially, variational autoencoders, allow for a better representation of the important features
for the machine learning model in an appropriate latent space. 
This repository contains the ongoing work on obtaining a good latent space representation of features included
in MODNet with low reconstruction loss. To achieve this goal autoencoder_tools package along with genetic algorithm
for hyperparameters optimization was applied.
