 This folder contains MODNet calculations with matbench_phonons dataset using the best regular autoencoder, but with different compressions. Specifically, the phonon data was compressed with the architeructe 2.2N-b named 2.2final with compression ratios of 100, 40, 60, 80, respectively. These calculations were performed to evaluate the performance of MODNet with different compression levels and determine if a particular compression factor is more suitable for this data.
 The experiments performed did not improve the predictions, then a specific encoder trained on the phonon set only, with the same architecture, Ph2.2f was tested, the result was a further degradation, meaning that still the autoencoder benefits from more data.
